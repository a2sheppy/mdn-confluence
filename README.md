# Tools for Cross-Referencing MDN Compat Data and Web API Confluence Data

These tools are intended for MDN Compat Data curators to leverage
[Web API Confluence](https://web-confluence.appspot.com/) data.

## Installing, building, running locally

    npm install && npm run build && npm run serve

Since this simply serves static assets, it assumes that
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` will sucessfully start an HTTP server on your
machine.
