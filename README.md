# Tools for Cross-Referencing MDN Compat Data and Web API Confluence Data

These tools are intended for
[MDN Compat Data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) curators to
leverage [Web API Confluence](https://web-confluence.appspot.com/) data.

## Installing, building, running locally

    npm install && npm run start

This will install the NPM package `firebase-tools` globally, and use the
Firebase CLI toolchain for local deployment.
